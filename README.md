This is a mail sorter app for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD).

Devs:

Ernie Trevino & Adam Camacho

This app takes a company's name as the input on the landing page, then outputs the employee responsible for handling that company's account.

The app also has an admin section accessible via the login link on the landing page which allows admins to:

     Add employees to the database.

     Remove employees from the database.

     Remove companies from the database.

     Reassign company accounts between employees as needed.

Here is a screenshot of the mockup for the landing page:
